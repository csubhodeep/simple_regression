# simple_regression

This is a repository containing two python scripts - one that trains a DT model on a bike sharing data-set to predict the hourly count of bikes shared, and the second one is a test script that can run some basic unit tests on the methods of the main class.

The data used for training and testing is taken from (here)[https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset].

Apart from this the code also aims to set an example on how a production-ready code is to be written to ensure maintainablity, extensibility and re-usability.
